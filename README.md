# Overview

What I am trying to accomplish is a better understanding of Game Framework. I chose Unreal Engine because it is a great introductory program into game development.

I made a target shooting game with Unreal Engine. You have to shoot four targets in 500 milliseconds. To move around, use the tradidional WASD keys. To shoot, use left-click on your mouse.

I wanted to create a game in Unreal Engine to enhance my programming skills and learn more about game development.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}
